Callbacks for Ruby. Ya heard? I'll let you know when it's ready.

h3. How it's going to work

<pre>
class Something

  before :foo do
    # do something before :foo
  end

  after :bar do |result_of_bar|
    # do something after :bar
  end

  def foo
    :foo
  end

  def bar
    :bar
  end
end
</pre>
